https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html:

A mutable memory location with "safe" dynamically checked borrow rules!

The checks are done at runtime to ensure certain memory-safe scenarios
are allowed, but if the rules are broken, the program will panic and exit.

Cell<T> will allow you to replace its value using the set() method, 
but unlike RefCell<T>, it will not give you an exclusive reference (&mut)
to that value.

RefCell<T> contains a value of type 'T' wrapped in UnsafeCell<T> - the core
primitive for interior mutability in Rust, and a state of type 'RefState' (enum)
wrapped in Cell<T> - a mutable memory location - which provides methods
to retrieve change the current interior value.

We wrap 'RefState' in Cell<T> because each time call borrow() or borrow_mut()
we take a shared reference to RefCell<T> (&self), match the state field,
and then change the state based on the borrowing rules enforced at
runtime. Now, suppose borrow() and borrow_mut() take exclusive references
to RefCell<T> (&mut self). It's clear that this would violate the borrowing
rules which we have enforced an runtime. This the perfect case for the use
of Cell<T> (Cell<RefState>) - to obtain interior mutability.

RefCell<T> keeps track of the number of active Ref<T> and RefMut<T> smart
pointers.

Borrowing rules: one exclusive reference (&mut) at a time or any number of
shared references (&).
